Some to dos:
 X Clean up scenes with no locations and / or characters. 
 - slider
 - Create a RESTful API for the dataset
 - Make the map look cooler and turn the scene selector into a slider
 - Be able to filter the social network graph
 - put it up on TwinPeaksData.website (which I bought for 98 cents) :)
 - get rid of non-characters in the display 
 - seems to be missing characters from the pilot stuff
- show other non-standard location information on the map

 Ideas? Thoughts?
