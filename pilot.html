Seated at a dining table beside a tea set we see a woman, 'LOG LADY' MARGARET
LANTERMEN. In her arms she carries a wooden log. She is speaking to us.<BR>

<B>LOG LADY</B><BR>
<UL><FONT FACE="ARIAL" SIZE="+1" COLOR="#339966">
  Welcome to Twin Peaks. My name is Margaret Lantermen.
    I live in Twin Peaks. I am known as the log lady. There is a story behind
    that. There are many stories in Twin Peaks. Some of them are sad, some
    funny. Some are stories of madness, of violence. Some are ordinary. Yet
    they all have about them a sense of mystery. The mystery of life, sometimes
    the mystery of death. The mystery of the woods, the woods surrounding Twin
    Peaks. To introduce this story let me just say it encompasses the all.
    It is beyond the fire. Though few would know that meaning. It is a story
    of many but it begins with one and I knew her. The one leading to the many
    is Laura Palmer. Laura is the one.</FONT>

walking slowly along the train tracks of a bridge. She is wearing only slip
that is dirty. Her makeup is smeared and there are tied loops of twine around
each wrist that have been cut and are hanging free. Nearby, at the end of

  Diane, 11:30 am, February 24. Entering the town

    of the state line. I've never seen so many trees in my life. As W. C. Fields
    would say I'd rather be here then in Philadelphia. Fifty-four degrees on
    a slightly overcast day. Weatherman said rain. If you get paid that kind
    of money for being wrong sixty percent of the time it beat working. My

    a look at that girl that crawled down the railroad tracks off the mountain.
    I'm pretty sure I'll be checking into a hotel. I'm sure the sheriff will

  Thank you sheriff. Ladies and gentlemen, Federal
    Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Dale Cooper. One year ago almost
    to the day in a town in the Southwest corner of this state the body of
    a young girl named Teresa Banks was found. She had no family, no one came
    forward to claim her body. It wasn't even news, until today. There are
    irrefutable similarities that for obvious reasons I can not discuss that
    lead us to conclude that Laura Palmer was the second and Ronette Pulaski
    would have been the third victim of the same killer. Now there is a chance
    that the person that committed these crimes is someone from this town,
    possibly even someone you know. You are the leaders of this community.
    It is vitally important that this not turn into a witch hunt. I would strongly
    suggest a temporary curfew for those under eighteen years of age. Keeping
    your kids off the streets now may teach them a degree of caution that may
    protect them in the days and the weeks to come. I will remind you that
    these crimes occurred at night.</FONT>
