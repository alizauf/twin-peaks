      "Cooper must overcome his deepest fears as he tracks down Windom Earle, who has kidnapped Annie, and has taken her into the sinister realm of the Black Lodge. Meanwhile, Nadine awakens after being hit on the head during the \"Miss Twin Peaks\" pageant, and is devastated after seeing Big Ed with Norma. Dr. Hayward engages in a tussle with Ben Horne, knocking him into the fireplace mantle as revenge for interfering with his family's affairs. The next day, as Truman and Andy wait for Cooper to return from the Black Lodge, Audrey stages an act of civil disobedience at the Twin Peaks Savings & Loan. Andrew and Pete obtain the safety deposit box key and try to unlock Thomas Eckhardt's final box in the bank. The box contains a bomb left behind by Eckhart which explodes when opened... apparently killing Andrew, Pete, and Audrey. Major Briggs receives a message from Windom Earle, who conveys it through Sarah Palmer. Cooper embarks on a strange and fateful journey into the Black Lodge, which results in his ultimate downfall. Cooper bargains with Earle for Annie's life. BOB kills Earle and takes his soul. Cooper meets his own evil shadow self and his shadow self emerges from the Lodge with the soul of the doppelgänger inhabited by BOB.\n",
