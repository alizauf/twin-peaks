    Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Yet there are those who open many eyes. Eyes are the
    mirror of the soul, someone has said. So we look closely at the eyes to see the nature of the
    soul. Sometimes when we see the eyes, those horrible times when we see the eyes, eyes that ...
    that have no soul. Then we know a darkness, then we wonder. Where is the beauty? There is
    none if the eyes are soulless.</FONT>

In the dark, we see MADELEINE slowly and quietly walk down the stairs. She
is wearing her large rimmed glasses and LAURA&#146;S thick, warm clothing. Her
dark hair is tied back and she is carrying a paper bag. The only sound in
the house is a grandfather clock chiming. At the bottom of the stairs she
passes the living room. Our view FOCUSES on the living room as she walks
on and out the front door. In the darkness of the living room we see a figure
sitting on the couch.<BR>

Near the gazebo, we see JAMES watch a car pull up. A blonde woman exits
from the passenger side and walks toward JAMES with her face hidden by the
shadows. JAMES stares at the woman as her features become more visible.
He meets her halfway and is in awe as he sees her face. The woman looks
exactly like LAURA PALMER but its MADELEINE wearing a blonde wig and LAURA&#146;S
clothes. DONNA, wearing a heavy coat and sporting a baseball cap, exits
from the driver&#146;s side and walks up to them carrying a video camera.<BR>

He reaches into the drawer and pulls out a revolver. He puts the phone receiver
down on his desk, gets out of his chair and walks to the door. DR. JACOBY
opens the door and scans the hallway with his gun ready. He looks down and
sees a large manila envelope beside the door. He picks it up, scans the
envelope for any identifying marks, opens it, pulls out a video cassette
and scans it for any identifying marks. DR. JACOBY walks back inside and
to his video player. He puts the tape in, picks up the remote and returns
to his seat.<BR>

DR. JACOBY replays the tape. He moves from his chair to the ground, closer
to his television set, in an attempt to view the paper LAURA/MADELEINE is
holding in her hands. He pauses the tape where he sees a gazebo beside her
in the background.<BR>

Outside the fenced area, we PAN to see JAMES and DONNA hiding behind some
garbage cans. They watch DR. JACOBY get into his car, start it up and quickly
drive off, peeling out in the process.<BR>
<BR>
With DR. JACOBY gone, JAMES and DONNA get up from behind the trash cans
and rush up the stairs into office building. With JAMES and DONNA gone,
BOBBY walks out from behind a corner of the building and sneaks over to
JAMES&#146;S motorcycle which is parked by the trash cans. He bends down to remove
a plastic bag of cocaine from his sock. He unscrews the gas tank cap, stuffs
the rolled up plastic bag of cocaine into the tank and replaces the gas
cap. He taps the gas tank with his hand and says ...<BR>
