As she speaks directly to us, the &#145;LOG LADY&#146; MARGARET LANTERMEN holds her wooden log in her
arms like a baby. The LOG LADY sits with her back to the fireplace of her cabin and beside a table.<BR>

<UL><FONT FACE="ARIAL" COLOR="#339966">
    A drunken man walks in a way that is quite impossible
    for a sober man to imitate, and vice versa. An evil man has a way, no matter
    how clever to the trained eye, his way will show itself. Am I being too
    secretive? No. One can never answer questions at the wrong moment. Life,
    like music, has a rhythm. This particular song will end with three sharp
    notes, like deathly drumbeats.</FONT>

From behind bushes and through DR. LAWRENCE JACOBY&#146;S POV, LAURA PALMER, actually

Still gazing at LAURA/MADELEINE, DR. JACOBY is hit from behind by a MAN dressed in all black
including a black ski mask. Caught off guard, DR. JACOBY falls face down onto the ground.<BR>
<BR>
We FOCUS on LAURA/MADELEINE as she hears something and turns to look in the direction from which she heard
the sound from.<BR>
<BR>
We FOCUS back on DR. JACOBY. With the sound of a BEATING drum representing a hearbeat, DR. JACOBY&#146;S
heart begins to race. The unknown MAN continues to hit DR. JACOBY in the back with his gloved fists.
DR. JACOBY lifts his head to look at LAURA/MADELEINE in the distance as he GRUNTS with each hit.<BR>

even more.<BR>

As the last scene, the TIGHT FOCUS on DR. JACOBY&#146;S left eye, FADES OUT we FADE IN to FOCUS on a

it stops in a marked crevice.<BR>

BIG ED shrugs and walks away from the roulette table. People can be heard
placing bets and laughing. BIG ED passes FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER as he
walks through the casino. AGENT COOPER is seated at a Black Jack table.
JACQUES RENAULT is the dealer. We FOCUS on COOPER and JACQUES as BIG ED walks
off. JACQUES speaks with a slight French-Canadian accent.<BR>

We FOCUS on a large card of the queen of diamonds. We ZOOM out to see an OLD LADY, with
a hunched back, sewing the card to the front of AUDREY&#146;S lingerie. There is a KNOCK
at the door. The OLD LADY scampers away.<BR>

As the last scene FADES OUT the next scene FADES IN. In a hallway of the hotel, AGENT DALE COOPER
walk up the hall toward his room. With his tie undone, AGENT COOPER is carrying his tuxedo jacket
in his left hand over his shoulder. In his right hand COOPER carries his mini tape recorder which
he is talking into.<BR>

    Diane, 4:37 am. After a long investigative night, returning to my room at the Great Northern.
    We have one suspect in custody and Leo Johnson, the man I believe was responsible for
    Laura&#146;s death, won&#146;t be able to escape the drag net we&#146;ve thrown up for him much longer.</FONT>

AGENT COOPER pauses to listen and looks around.<BR>

    As you can hear from the ambient sound around me ... and I notice with some relief, that the
    Icelandic group staying on my floor have either checked or passed out. I may not need the Ear
    Pillow ear plugs. Which I did receive today Diane. Although I suspect I may put them to use
    as a purely precautionary measure. I ordered some hot milk from room service. Here&#146;s
    hoping that does the job and I&#146;ll be able to catch a few hours of quality sack time.
    Twenty-four hour room service must be one of the premiere achievements of modern civilization.</FONT>

COOPER turns off his mini tape recorder, unlocks the door to his room, opens it and enters.<BR>
